# poco-training

A set of poco samples. Each sample is in the corresponding category, e.g Networking, Process, etc.

## Projects Layout
Regarding each category we have a separate project, i.e subproject, which is based on CMake. There should be src directory for every project that contains all source files, and another include directory that houses project header files.
